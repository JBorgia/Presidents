This project serves as a directory of the 44 presidents. The user can input a
term number and the respective information will be displayed, including party,
popularity, and years in office. The Prev and Next buttons allow the user to
browse continuously.

To build this, we found a CSV file and edited it to meet our needs. We pulled
images from Wikipedia and other sources and parsed in the file. Arraylists and
loops helped us display the needed information. We also used JSTL, HTML, CSS,
and Java to create this interactive webpage.


To further improve this, we could create radio buttons or a drop-down menu to
filter each category (e.g. party, occupation, college attended) to display the
presidents meeting the selected criteria. On November 8, we will have a 45th
president, so we may update the website to reflect that.

AWS address: The deployment is Monday after this is due, but I will update this
section.
